Previous studies typically focus either on scientific HPC benchmarks or previous cloud configurations, failing to consider all the new opportunities offered by current cloud offerings. We present a comparative study of the performance of representative big data benchmarks, or \"Big Data Ogres\", and HPC benchmarks running on supercomputer and cloud. Our work distinguishes itself from previous studies in a way that we explore the latest generation of compute-optimized Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, C4 for our experimentation on cloud. Our results reveal that Amazon C4 instances with increased compute performance and low variability in results make EC2-based cluster feasible for scientific computing and its applications in simulations, modeling and analysis.","tags":["Big Data;cloud computing;parallel processing;HPC;Performance evaluation;Amazon EC2 C4;Graph500"],"title":"Evaluation of HPC-Big Data Applications Using Cloud Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"    Sometimes it can be hard to see the benefit of progress when, in order to move forward, we must leave behind a part of ourselves that we’ve cherished so intensely. When you know taking that one step forward will break you away from a moment that can never be revisited, where do you find the courage to move?\nWe are pushed forward in life whether we make the step willingly or not. There is birth, then we mature, matriculate, graduate, procreate, and then we cease to be. At each of these junctions, the “now” is comprised of both the past and the future. On the edge of “before” and “after”, the brilliance of the future is obscured by the longing for the past.
