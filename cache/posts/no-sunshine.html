<p>Sometimes it can be hard to see the benefit of progress when, in order to move forward, we must leave behind a part of ourselves that we’ve cherished so intensely. When you know taking that one step forward will break you away from a moment that can never be revisited, where do you find the courage to move?</p>
<p>We are pushed forward in life whether we make the step willingly or not. There is birth, then we mature, matriculate, graduate, procreate, and then we cease to be. At each of these junctions, the “now” is comprised of both the past and the future. On the edge of “before” and “after”, the brilliance of the future is obscured by the longing for the past. The rays of the sun will not penetrate clouds of sadness today.</p>
<p>Not today.</p>
<p>The end is the beginning and the beginning is the end.</p>
