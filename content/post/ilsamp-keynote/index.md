On February 2021, I presented the keynote the 2021 [ILSAMP](https://www.csu.edu/ILSAMP/) Annual Spring Symposium & Student Research Conference titled **"Finding Opportunities in Everyday Encounters: An Agile Approach to Dealing with Life's Unpredictability"**. In this talk, I discussed my strategies for overcoming challenges by taking the unconventional paths in life. It was great to share my experience with undergraduate students from colleges and universities across Illinois, and a pleasure to be involved in such a wonderful program.


Below is the recording of my talk.
