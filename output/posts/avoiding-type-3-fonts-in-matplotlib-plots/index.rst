So you've generated your figure/PDF with matplotlib and your conference/journal publishers tell you that you have unsupported font types. Chances are, based on my experience with ACM, you have some Type 3 fonts. Jamie Oak wrote `this blog post <http://phyletica.org/matplotlib-fonts/>`_ on how to avoid Type 3 PostScript fonts in the pdf generated by matplotlib. Just add a couple lines to the top of your scripts and voil√†!

Below is one of the figures that were flagged.
